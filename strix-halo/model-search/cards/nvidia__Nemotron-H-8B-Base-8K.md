# Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K

## Model Overview 

NVIDIA Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K is a large language model (LLM) developed by NVIDIA that is designed as a completion model for a given piece of text. It uses a hybrid model architecture that consists primarily of Mamba-2 and MLP layers combined with just four Attention layers. The model features a context length of 8K. The supported languages include: English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese. For more detailed information on the model architecture, training, and evaluation, please see the [project page](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/adlr/nemotronh/) and the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03624).

For best performance on a given task, users are encouraged to customize the model using the [NeMo Framework](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/index.html) suite of customization tools including Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (P-tuning, Adapters, LoRA, and more), and Model Alignment (SFT, SteerLM, RLHF, and more) using [NeMo-Aligner](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner).

This model is for research and development only.

This model is part of the Nemotron-H Collection. You can find the models in this family here:

### Example

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load the tokenizer and model
tokenizer  = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("nvidia/Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K", trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("nvidia/Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, trust_remote_code=True).cuda()

prompt = "When was NVIDIA founded?"

outputs = model.generate(**tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", add_special_tokens=False).to(model.device))
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```

## Training, Testing, and Evaluation Datasets

### Training & Testing Datasets:

The training corpus for Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K consists of English and multilingual text (German, Spanish, French, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Chinese and English), as well as code. Our sources cover a variety of document types such as: webpages, dialogue, articles, and other written materials. This model was also improved using synthetic data from Qwen (Built with Qwen). The corpus spans domains including legal, math, science, finance, and more. We also include a small portion of question-answering, and alignment style data to improve model accuracy.

## Potential Known Risks for Usage

The model was trained on data that contains toxic language and societal biases originally crawled from the internet. Therefore, the model may amplify those biases and return toxic responses especially when prompted with toxic prompts. The model may generate answers that may be inaccurate, omit key information, or include irrelevant or redundant text producing socially unacceptable or undesirable text, even if the prompt itself does not include anything explicitly offensive.

The model demonstrates weakness to indirect prompt injection via some encodings, including Base16, Hex/ASCII, and Braille, though is more resilient than other similar models to injections using the more common Base64 vector.

## Inference
- Engine: NeMo
- Test Hardware NVIDIA H100-80GB
